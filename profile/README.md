# Welcome to TableChat
**TableChat** is a SQL tool powered by generated  AI designed to assist SQL development. It leverages the capabilities of AI  LLM (Large Language Models) to implement the database operations people need, ensure compatibility with different databases,  use text to generate SQL, optimize read and write operations, and provide excellent data visualizations and insights.

### Exactly Generated SQL statement  with AI
TableChat  allows developers to generate SQL queries exactly according to their table structures and multi-table relationships. It makes AI work with their real data and generate production-ready database operation statements. By utilizing the capabilities of LLM models with interactive dialogue,  complex database operations, cross-database language conversions (e.g., from MySQL to Oracle), and database statement optimization can be easily realized.

**Powerful Data Visualizations and Insights**
<br>
For the datasets generated by developers, TableChat provide exciting table display, statistics, and filtering capabilities. This enables developers to quickly gain insights into data and prepare for further data operations.
TableChat offers built-in data visualization capabilities that allow developers, DBAs, and data analysts to explore and analyze data more effectively. These tools can generate visual representations of complex data sets,  providing exciting table display, statistics, and filtering capabilities. This enables informed decision-making based on actionable insights.

**Intelligent Code Suggestions**
<br>
Our SQL IDE is equipped with intelligent code completion features that significantly speed up the development process. This tool analyzes the code you are writing and suggest completions for code snippets, SQL commands, or table and column names, based on the context and your past coding patterns. This feature eliminates the need for manual typing, reduces errors, and enhances code accuracy.

**Automatic Object Structure Generation**
<br>
Based on existing table structures, developers can rapidly get customized object structures (for OOP project) in different programming languages. this can prevent people from table name confusion. This makes this tool is useful not only to database administrator but also to all developers.
