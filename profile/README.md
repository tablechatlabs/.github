# Welcome to TableChat
**TableChat** is a SQL/BigData tool powered by generated  AI designed to assist SQL/BigData development. It leverages the capabilities of AI  LLMs (Large Language Models) to implement the database operations people need, ensure compatibility with different databases,  use text to generate SQL, optimize read and write operations, and provide excellent data visualizations and insights.

## Key Features
### Exactly Generated SQL/BigData statement  with AI
TableChat  allows developers to generate SQL/BigData queries exactly according to their table structures or data schema. It makes AI work with their real data and generate production-ready database/data warehouse operation statements.

By utilizing the capabilities of LLMs with interactive dialogue,  complex database operations, cross-database language conversions, and database statement optimization can be easily realized.

### Powerful Data Visualizations and Insights
TableChat offers built-in data visualization capabilities that allow developers, DBAs, and data analysts to explore and analyze data more effectively. It  can generate visual representations of complex data sets,  providing exciting table display, statistics, and filtering capabilities. This enables informed decision-making based on data insights. Developers can also clearly show the results to colleagues.

### Automatic Object Structure Generation
Based on existing table structures, developers can rapidly get customized object structures (for OOP project) in different programming languages. This can prevent people from table name confusion. This makes the tool useful not only to database administrator but also to all developers.

### Intelligent Code Suggestions
Our SQL/BigData IDE is equipped with intelligent code completion features that significantly speed up the development process. This tool analyzes the code you are writing and suggests completions for code snippets, SQL/BigData commands, and table column names, based on the context and your past coding patterns. This feature eliminates the need for manual typing, reduces errors, and enhances code accuracy.
